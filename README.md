Pytest plugin for testing the idempotency of a function.

## Usage

```
pip install pytest-idempotent
```

## Documentation

Suppose we had the following function, that we (incorrectly) assumed is idempotent (AKA we should be able to run it more than once without any adverse effects).

```python
from pytest_idempotent import idempotent  # or use your own decorator!

@idempotent
def func(x: list[int]) -> None:
    x += [9]
```

Note: this function is _not_ idempotent because calling it on the same list `x` grows the size of `x` by 1 each time.

We can write an idempotency test for this function as follows:

```python
# idempotency_test.py
import pytest

@pytest.mark.idempotent
def test_func() -> None:
    x: list[int] = []

    func(x)

    assert x == [9]
```

Adding the `@pytest.mark.idempotent` mark automatically splits this test into two - one that tests the regular behavior and one that tests that the function can be called twice without adverse effects.

```

## How It Works

Idempotency is a difficult pattern to enforce. To solve this issue, **pytest-idempotent** takes the following approach:

- Introduce a decorator, `@idempotent`, to functions.

  - This decorator serves as a visual aid. If this decorator is commonly used in the codebase, it is much easier to consider idempotency for new and existing functions.
  - At runtime, this decorator is a no-op.
  - At test-time, if the feature is enabled, we will run the decorated function twice with the same parameters in all test cases.
  - We can also assert that the second run returns the same result as an additional parameter to the function's decorator: `@idempotent(equal_return=True)`.

- For all tests marked using `@pytest.mark.idempotent`, we run each test twice: once normally, and once with the decorated function called twice.
  - Both runs need to pass all assertions.
  - We return the first result because the first run should complete the processing. The second will either return exact the same result or be a no-op.
  - To disable idempotency testing for a test or group of tests, use:
  `@pytest.mark.idempotent(run_twice=False)`

## @idempotent decorator

By default, the `@idempotent` decorator does nothing during runtime. We do not want to add overhead to production code to run tests.

```python
from typing import Any, Callable, TypeVar

_F = TypeVar("_F", bound=Callable[..., Any])


def idempotent(func: _F) -> _F:
    """
    No-op during runtime.
    This marker allows pytest-idempotent to override the decorated function
    during test-time to verify the function is idempotent.
    """
    return func
```

To use your own `@idempotent` decorator, you can override the `pytest_idempotent_decorator` function in your `conftest.py` to return the module path to your implementation.

```python
# conftest.py
# Optional: you can define this to ensure the plugin is correctly installed
pytest_plugins = ["pytest_idempotent"]


def pytest_idempotent_decorator() -> str:
    """This links to my custom implementation of @idempotent."""
    return "src.utils.idempotent"
```
